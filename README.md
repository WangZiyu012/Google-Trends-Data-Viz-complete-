# Combine Google Trends with other Time Series Data

What can the popularity of search terms tell us about the world? 

Google Trends gives us access to the popularity of Google Search terms. Let's investigate:

1. How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin;

2. How search volume for a hot stock like Telsa relates to that stock's price;

3. How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States.
